## Usage
This page can be used a landing page for a product.  Right now it is set up to show playstation | xbox .  
The images can be changed easily to whatever need presents itself.  As you move the mouse over the two halves of the screen, the half that you are on will become the main image.  Both buttons have a hover effect.  (right now they are not live) Possible future changes could involve 
making changing the color scheme, adding dark/light theme toggle.
